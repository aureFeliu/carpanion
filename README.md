# Carpanion

Carpanion is an Android mobile application that allows students to discover others in their area travelling to the same college to reduce the number of students travelling alone and to share the cost of travel. Carpanion was made as part of a research project I conducted during my final year in LIT. I observed how many students travel alone by car to college and came up with a concept mobile application to help solve this problem.

### Technologies used:
 - Java
 - Android Studio
 - Firebase (Database, Cloud Functions, Cloud Messaging, Storage)
